# Pose Detection using MediaPipe Model with Kalman & Butterworth Filters
This project performs human pose detection in video streams using the MediaPipe Pose model. The detected landmarks are refined with Kalman and Butterworth filters to reduce noise, resulting in smoother and more accurate visualization of body movements.
